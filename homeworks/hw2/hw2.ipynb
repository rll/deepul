        "This semester, all homeworks will be conducted through Google Colab notebooks. All code for the homework assignment will be written and run in this notebook. Running in Colab will automatically provide a GPU, but you may also run this notebook locally by following [these instructions](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/local-runtimes.html) if you wish to use your own GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will save images in the notebooks to use and fill out a given LaTeX template which will be submitted to Gradescope, along with your notebook code.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Using Colab\n",
        "On the left-hand side, you can click the different icons to see a Table of Contents of the assignment, as well as local files accessible through the notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "Make sure to go to **Runtime -> Change runtime type** and select **GPU** as the hardware accelerator. This allows you to use a GPU. Run the cells below to get started on the assignment. Note that a session is open for a maximum of 12 hours, and using too much GPU compute may result in restricted access for a short period of time. Please start the homework early so you have ample time to work.\n",

        "In each homework problem, you will implement various autoencoder models and run them on two datasets (dataset 1 and dataset 2). The expected outputs for dataset 1 are already provided to help as a sanity check.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feel free to print whatever output (e.g. debugging code, training code, etc) you want, as the graded submission will be the submitted pdf with images.\n",
